You have
Always seen
The best parts of me
With my uncovered eyes
Loose from lenses, Absorbing Light
Your hand is wrapped in mine
The sun set for the last time
Carpet stains from coffee cups
Thrown to stop from hurting so much
Paralyzed I thought I'd fail
You somehow, and let you down
But you saved me from Death
Awake and alive for the first time
Joining as voices sing
Together the same song
